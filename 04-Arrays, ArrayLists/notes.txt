Memory allocation,static(stack) memory, dynamic(heap) memory
- Reference : https://javachallengers.com/memory-allocation-with-java/

1)Each memory slot holds 1 byte.
2)1 byte is the same as 8 bits.
3)Boolean would need 1 bit size but will be stored in 1 byte to avoid having different data in the same memory slot.
4)Every variable value behind the scenes becomes a binary number so the computer can understand it.
5)An array will occupy memory space contiguously, this means data has to be stored from back to back.
6)An array in Java will occupy more space in memory due to the internal JVM configurations.
7)The static memory in Java is the stack memory.
8)The stack memory will keep methods and variables alive until they are finished. It’s also thread-safe.
9)The dynamic memory in Java is the heap memory.
10)The heap memory in Java is more complex and it’s mainly responsible to manage instances of objects.
